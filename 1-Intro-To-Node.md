# 401 JS


# WTF is Node JS
 - allows us to build javascript applications through a framework
 - uses a single threaded, event driven, i/o architecture
 - Event loop adds to the callback queue, which handles i/o asynchronously at the OS level

# Modular Patterns in Node JS
Specific ways to handle concepts of modularity in Node JS
- Node has a global object: 'this' will return framework of Node
- *require* can grab
Node objects - ex. const var = require('express')
  - uses Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)

# 1-hello-world
access the Node repl:
```sh
node
```

access the global object on Node:
```sh
this
```
