# Big O

O denotes the efficiency and complexity of an expression.
N denotes the worst case scenarios

Through one expression => O = 1;
Through an array => O(n);

Objects can operate under a 1 to 1 construct => If I want red off of my Colors Object, I can grab it via Colors.red. I don't have to iterate to objects to get my value.
